      Some of our projects took years to complete and the most valuable resource in science are references. We belief in
      open science. Research should be accessible to all! Thus, we share our data and findings for full transparency,
      replication, or re-usability on this platform. It is free for everyone to use (limitations apply)! In any case, we
      always appreciate it if you let us know when you are planning to use our data.

      All bibliometric data <i>(e.g. title, abstract, publication year, authors, ...)</i> is based on
      <a href="https://openalex.org/" target="_blank">OpenAlex</a>. All auxiliary information was annotated by hand,
      using automated classifiers, or in some (semi-/un-)supervised manner. Usually, the datasets are linked to a
      specific publication.
