    This interactive website accompanies the paper [1], which uses machine learning to identify and classify the
    literature on climate policy instruments. You can explore this literature in the map below, where each paper is
    represented by a dot, and papers which are linguistically similar are placed close together on the plot. Hovering
    over the map will show the titles of the papers.

    You can select papers by clicking and dragging on the map to zoom in on an area. Or you can choose a different type
    of selection method using the icons in the top left. Once you have selected documents, a sample of these will be
    shown in the box below. You will also have the opportunity to download the complete selection of documents,
    including the machine-learning generated labels.
